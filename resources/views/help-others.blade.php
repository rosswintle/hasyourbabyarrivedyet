    <p class="mb-4">Most of the children that this site will announce the birth of will go straight
        into loving, safe, family homes.  This isn’t true for many other children.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">So hasyourbabyarrivedyet is promoting the work of
        <a href="http://www.childsifoundation.org/">Child’s i Foundation</a> – an
        amazing charity that places orphaned Ugandan children into family care.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">hasyourbabyarrivedyet is free, but if you use it and find it useful, please consider
        supporting Child’s i by <a href="http://www.childsifoundation.org/">reading their stories</a>
            and by
